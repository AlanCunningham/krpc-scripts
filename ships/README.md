# Example ships

These ships have been used to develop the scripts in this project, so should
work out of the box.  Ideally, we'd like these scripts to accommodate *any*
ship, however these examples can be used as a starting point or for testing.

# How to use

Copy the `.craft` file to the following directory:
```
<kerbal_installation_folder>/saves/Sandbox/Ships/VAB/
```

You should then be able to load these ships in game.  Note that the above path
assumes you're playing in Sandbox mode.
